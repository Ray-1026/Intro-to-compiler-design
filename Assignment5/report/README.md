## How much time did you spend on this project

> about 1.5 days

## Project overview

Just generate the corresponding RISC-V while visiting the nodes. Only the compound statement and nested for loop are more complicated than others. 

### Compound Statement
I use the if-else to determine different conditions.

### Nested For Loop
When entering for loop, I divide the label and put them in the group to handle nested for loop.

## What is the hardest you think in this project

I think that RISC-V is the hardest part because I'm not familiar with assembly language so that I can't detect which part is wrong in my generated RISC-V clearly.

## Feedback to T.A.s

Thank you T.A.s and professor. Have a nice holiday!!!
